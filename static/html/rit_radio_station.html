                WITR 89.7 is RIT’s student run radio station. Independent multi-genre music 
                has been beamed 25 miles in all directions of RIT since 1961. In addition 
                to providing great music WITR holds New York State’s second largest vinyl 
                record library. In 1992, the count was estimated at 30,000 records and 5,000 CD’s.

                    During my time as the Internal Developer at WITR I rebuilt their 
                    music logger, maintained their current website, and designed a new 
                    website. In the past the music logger ran off of long polling to be 
                    notified of each new song played on air, this approach was not only 
                    fragile but had a memory leak problem. As a more robust approach I built 
                    the new logger using web sockets.

                    Not only did the Logger need to work well for the public, DJs also needed 
                    to be able to manually add songs to it during their sets. Once the Logger 
                    detects it has been opened in the radio station subnet it shows a UI to add 
                    and edit tracks.

                    Working for the student run radio station offered an intersting contrast from 
                    the monoloth BMW plant. I enjoyed the opportunity to give back to my school 
                    and engage with new friends on a personal level.
