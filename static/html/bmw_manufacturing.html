                BMW Manufacturing in Greenville, South Caronlina produces the BMW X line. This 
                factory is the largest BMW factory in the world by volume and employs over 
                15,000 people. Working here made me feel like a small fish in a big pond.

                Here, I was a part of the final fit and finish line. My job was to automate the 
                key performance indicator sheet, a diagram of various statistics from the 
                previous shift, which was prepared every day for the morning meeting.

                The code I was writing was mostly SQL queries and a bit of visual basic, both 
                for the Oracle suite. The main task here, though, was hunting down database 
                credentials across the ocean of factory offices. I learned how to compose a 
                professional email asking for production database credentials, and when that 
                email innevitably was put asside by itâ€™s recipient, I learned the rest of the 
                arcane arts required to get something done in a coporate environment.

                Working in this factory was a far ways away from the under 30 person office 
                I was in the previous month at FltPlan. This internship gave me the oportunity 
                to learn how a fortune 50 company is run, and all systems and structure it 
                takes to do so.

                I also took a week long class to learn how to program these robots.
