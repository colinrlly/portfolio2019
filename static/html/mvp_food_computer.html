            <h3>What it is</h3>
            <p>
                The MIT OpenAg Food Computer is a hyper local food growth chamber controlling
                light, humidity, temperature and many other factors which contribute to 
                optimal plant success.
            </p>
            <p>
                    Spun off from this Food Computer project is a smaller, more affordable
                    project called the MVP (minimal viable product). Where the Food Computer
                    costs around $1500 dollars to create, the MVP costs around $300. Designed
                    for education the MVP allows someone new to the field to engage in
                    controlled environment agriculture for a relatively low price.

            <h3>What I Did</h3>
            <p>
                    I did two things: I built the MVP according to these designs, and I
                    extended the project by creating a dashboard to view the vitals of
                    my box on my own website.
            </p>
            <p>
                    By building the box I dove into the internet of things, figuring out
                    how to send temperature and humidty data between the computer on the
                    MVP and my own web server. I learned about soldering and wire stripping 
                    (things they don't teach you in a computer science degree). And about 
                    what factors contribute to proper hydroponic growth, such as ideal air 
                    temperature, water nutrients, and amount of light. Different ways to 
                    grow hydroponically such as the Food Computer's Areoponics, Cornel's 
                    ebb and flow system, or the MVP's basic bin full of water with plants 
                    sitting in it.
            </p>

            <p>
                    Building a dashboard and sending information around the internet 
                    leveraged my web development knowledge and hopefully will be able 
                    to answer some questions the OpenAg community has on storing the 
                    MVP's data in the cloud. Also, figuring out how to send images 
                    from the Raspberry Pi to my web server inspired me to write an article.

            <h3>Inspiration</h3>
            <p>
                The dream is solar powered, automatic farms that run themselves and
                cost no electricity. These kind of projects are already under way by 
                teams like Mars Farm, OpenAg, and Cornel CEA. The robotic, fully 
                automatic vision has yet to be answered while the fully solar powered 
                farm has been deemed unadvisable by Cornel CEA.
            </p>
            <p>
                This ted talk by Caleb Harper, the director of MIT OpenAg, explains 
                the vision behind Food Computers. A network of plants boxes learning 
                how to grow the perfect crop. I was inspired by this idea and decided 
                to build and cotribute to the project.
            </p>
            <h3>Problems I Faced</h3>
            <p>
                I have found the temperature in the MVP often reaches crazy levels 
                throughout the day. Usually sitting around 95 degrees. Far from the 
                optimal 77 degrees stated in the documentation. The MVP relies on 
                two computer fans to cool the grow chamber. One for circulation 
                hanging from the top of the box, and another for evacuation attatched 
                to the side. Although I do question the ability of two computer fans 
                to cool the chamber, my circulation fan broke about halfway through 
                the experiment which probably has something to do with the temperature 
                reaching such levels. I taped the edges of the box closed which will 
                hopefully create a more air tight seal, encouraging a greater amount 
                of air to exit via the evacuation fan. I have yet to see if this 
                solves the problem.
            </p>
            <img src="../images/mvp_temp.jpg">
            <p>
                The light on the top of my MVP was actually slightly tilted. I didn't 
                think much of this, the inside of the box is so reflective I assumed 
                such a minor problem wouldn't make a difference. As time went on though 
                the plants in the direction the light was tilted actually grew more 
                than the plants on the other side. The successful plants were closer 
                to the door opening, maybe getting fresher air than the ones in the 
                back, but nonetheless I thought it was interesting that such a minor 
                adjustment of the light position could have such a potentially large 
                impact on plant growth.
            </p>
            <h3>Ideas For The Future</h3>
            <p>
                    Precision agriculture has already proven itself as incredibly 
                    important, estimated as a $240 billion dollar industry. But how 
                    far will it go? Will entirely controlled growing environments be 
                    the future of food? What role will tech have in humanities oldest front?
            </p>
            <p>
                    One day I'd like to grow more interesting plants in my setup, such as 
                    herbs and maybe tea plants. Growing food locally, in regions it 
                    doesn't naturally grow, is a huge potential for this tech. Certain 
                    regions of the world such as China and Costa Rica produce some of 
                    the most sought after tea and coffee in the world. What factors 
                    contribute to their success? And can those factors be replicated 
                    in a controlled environment anywhere in the world?
